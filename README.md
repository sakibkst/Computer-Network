## Introduction

A **Computer Network** is a set of computers, servers, and other devices connected together to share resources and communicate with each other. It can range from small local area networks (LANs) to vast, global networks like the internet. The goal of this repository is to provide educational content, practical code examples, and tools for understanding and implementing various aspects of computer networks.
